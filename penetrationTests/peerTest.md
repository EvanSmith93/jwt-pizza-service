| Description    | The backend endpoint for the docs page returns relevant information for the docs page. However, it also returns the database URL.

| Description    | When an unhandled error occurs within the app, the stack trace is returned to the user. While this is not a specific attack in and of itself, it could make it much easier for an attacker to find vulnerabilities because they can tell what's happening within the system. For instance, I noticed the stack trace for an incorrect login was different depending on whether the email was a valid user. |

| Description    | When the database is initialized, an admin user is automatically created with a default username and password. The password is "admin", which is an easy to guess password. This allows anyone to easily guess the password and log in as an admin. In addition, anyone who looks at the code (since the code is public on GitHub) will be able to tell what the default password is. |
| Images         | ![Code that sets default credentials](defaultCredentials.png) <br/> This is the code that sets the default admin user. The password is insecure and is visible to anyone who looks at the code.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Corrections    | Store the default admin password (and possibly also the username) within environment variables both locally and in production. Ensure that the password is something harder to guess.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Peer attack

The first thing I tried was to log into his system using the default credentials (username of a@jwt.com and password of admin). However, no such user existed. I could tell that a@jwt.com didn't exist because of the error's stack trace.

I was going to attempt my SQL injection attack, however I noticed by looking at his repository that he had removed the updateUser endpoint, which is the only endpoint I found that was vulnerable to SQL injection. So, this was no longer an option.

On his fork of the jwt-pizza-service repository, I went to his GitHub actions. Under the latest successful pipeline run, I downloaded the package. Contained within it was the config.js file with many of his credentials. I tried several things with these credentials.

I attempted to connect to his database using the database URL and password. However, he had public access to the database disabled, which prevented me from connecting.

With his JWT secret, I tried to sign a JWT token saying I was an admin user. However, in addition to the app using a JWT secret, it also checks to see if the token was in the database. This meant I would need to know what user he was currently signed in as, and recreate his exact same JWT token. Since I did not know the email for any admin users, I was unable to do this.

I spent a while trying to guess an email for an admin user, in hopes I could combine this with the JWT secret to gain admin access. I would try and log in with various emails and checked the error stack trace to see whether or not the email was correct. I tried several variations on a@jwt.com, such as admin@jwt.com and a@test.com. I also looked through his code to see what default emails he used while testing, in hopes he used the same ones for production. Finally, I tried using his BYU email. None of these ended up working. I learned later that he accidentally renamed his admin user's email when attempting a SQL injection attack.

Finally, I had his Grafana metrics and logging API keys. I created a script to repeatedly send metrics reporting large latencies to his Grafana account. I used code from his jwt-pizza-service repository to ensure that it was in the correct format. On my end, it looked like the fake metrics were sending correctly. However, I checked with him afterwards and he didn't see any change on his metrics dashboard. With more time, I likely could've gotten this attack working.

In the end, I was not able to attack his system in any way (other than gaining access to various secrets). For that reason, I did not create any attack records.

## Learning summary

- It would've been better to have a penetration testing environment, and think of it more like testing. We both messed up our production systems when trying to do penetration testing on ourselves.
- Hackers are really good at what they do. They have to understand everything at a very low level.
- It's harder to see if the backend is broken or misconfigured since the backend doesn't have visuals. You could be accidentally returning things or allowing things and not realize it for a long time.
- It's important to have a security mindset when programming because of how easy it is to forget something.
- Having your code publicly available can make it easier for people to attack you because they're able to find exploits easier. You should design your system to be secure even if attackers can look at your code or your pipelines. The GitHub Actions pipeline let anyone download the artifacts which contained secrets in there. You have to think about security beyond just the code.
- It was nice to be able to look though the list of most common attacks. There were many things we didn't even know were popular.
