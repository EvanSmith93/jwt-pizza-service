| Description    | When the database is initialized, an admin user is automatically created with a default username and password. The password is "admin", which is an easy to guess password. This allows anyone to easily guess the password and log in as an admin. In addition, anyone who looks at the code (since the code is public on GitHub) will be able to tell what the default password is. |
| Images         | ![Code that sets default credentials](defaultCredentials.png) This is the code that sets the default admin user. The password is insecure and is visible to anyone who looks at the code.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Corrections    | Store the default admin password (and possibly also the username) within environment variables both locally and in production. Ensure that the password is something harder to guess.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Learning summary

- It would've been better to have a penetration testing environment, and think of it more like testing. We both messed up our production systems when trying to do penetration testing on ourselves.
- Hackers are really good at what they do. They have to understand everything at a very low level.
- It's harder to see if the backend is broken or misconfigured since the backend doesn't have visuals. You could be accidentally returning things or allowing things and not realize it for a long time.
- It's important to have a security mindset when programming because of how easy it is to forget something.
- Having your code publicly available can make it easier for people to attack you because they're able to find exploits easier. You should design your system to be secure even if attackers can look at your code or your pipelines. The GitHub Actions pipeline let anyone download the artifacts which contained secrets in there. You have to think about security beyond just the code.
- It was nice to be able to look though the list of most common attacks. There were many things we didn't even know were popular.
